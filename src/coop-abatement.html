                      The prevailing wage affidavit certifies that all building service employees currently employed or to be employed at the property receive the applicable wage for the duration of the property’s tax abatement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Failure to file the affidavit will result in the entire building being ineligible to receive the abatement. Prevailing wage is enforced by the City Comptroller. If you file an affidavit but are found to not have paid the proper prevailing wage, the building could be subject to civil penalties and may be ineligible to receive the abatement.

                      If you choose not to provide the prevailing wage affidavit or don’t wish to continue receiving this abatement for another reason, you must opt out. To opt out of receiving the cooperative/condominium abatement, log in to <a href="#">www.nyc.gov/ccabatement</a> and <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/finance/downloads/pdf/coop_condo_abatement/coop-condo-benefit_opt-out.pdf">submit the “Co-op/Condo Tax Abatement Benefit Opt-Out” form</a>.

                      You only need to submit the opt-out form once. The abatement will be removed effective July 1 following the deadline to file. To apply for the cooperative/condominium abatement in future years, you must comply with all requirements and submit a new application.
